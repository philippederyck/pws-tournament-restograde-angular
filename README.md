# Training application on Stackblitz

This [Pragmatic Web Security](https://pragmaticwebsecurity.com) training application is built to run on Stackblitz. You are able to browse the code, make edits, and see the live application running in the preview panel.

__Note that some browsers like Brave restrict Stackblitz from running. Make sure you either allow Stackblitz to run applications or use a browser without these restrictions for this lab.__
